As the name suggests, the {% include %} is used to include HTML templates
in atother template. It's a very useful way to reuse HTML components in a
project

The next form we implement, we can simply use
{% include 'includes/form.html' %} to render it

Now we are using the assertIsInstance method. Basically we are grabbing the form
instance in the context data, and checking if it is a NewTopicForm

In the last test, we added the self.assertTrue(form.errors) to make sure the
form is showing errors when the data is invalid
