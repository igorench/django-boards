The whole idea of this kind of URL routing is to create dynamic pages where
part of the URL will be used as an identifier for a certain resource, that will
be used to compose a page. This identifier can be an integer ID or a string for
example

The name in regular expression wouldn't matter. But is a good practice to use
named parametrs because when we start composing bigger URLs capturing multiple
IDs and variables, it will be easer to read

So in the setUp method, we prepare the environment to run the tests, so to
simulate a scenario

Always use the {% url %} template tag to compose the applications URLs. The
first parametr is the name of the URL (defined in the URLconf, i.e., the
urls.py), then you can pass an arbitrary number of arguments as needed.

URL routing is a fundamental part of a web application
