No matter if the code is stored in a public or private remote repository, sensetive information should 
never be committed and pushed to the remote repository. That includes secret keys, passwords, API keys
etc.

At this point, we have to deal with two specific types of configuration in our settings.py module:
- Sensetive information such as keys and passwords
- Configurations that are specific to a given environment

Python Decouple - it will search for a local file named .env to set the configuration variables and will
fall back to the environment variables. It also provides an interface to define default values, transform 
the data into int, bool, and list when applicable

The .env file is ignored in the .gitignore file, so every time we are going to deploy the application or run 
in a different machine, we will have to create a .env file and add the necessary configuration 

It's a good practice to keep track of the project's dependencies, so to be easier to install it on
another machine
